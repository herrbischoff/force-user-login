Description
===========

This is a very small plugin that forces users to login before viewing any content. This is done by checking if the user is logged in, and if not, redirecting them to the login page. Users attempting to view blog content via RSS are also authenticated via HTTP Auth.

Caffeinating
============

When you find this helpful, you could buy me a coffee. Keeping me properly caffeinated accelerates things. And it would really make my day. Kindness of strangers and all that. If you can't or won't, no hard feelings. It's available completely free for a reason. Still, it would be awesome.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Can I change where the user is redirected after logging in?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yes! A variable called $redirect_to (line 33) is currently set to redirect the user to the page they were trying to access. If you changed that line from

`$redirect_to = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];`

to

`$redirect_to = '/';`

it would redirect the user to the home page.

Screenshots
===========

None taken. Just a login screen.
